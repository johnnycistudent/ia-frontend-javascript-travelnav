# Interactive Front End Milestone Project

Welcome to my Interactive Front End Milestone Project which I have called Travel-Nav. This website allows users to search any destination in the world and find tourist attractions, places to eat and places to stay.
Once a destination is entered into the search bar above/beside the map, the map will pan and zoom to your desired destination and will populate with markers from whichever button you have clicked from the button group adjacent to the map.
Once the  markers have populated, you can click on them and explore the infoWindow that pops up, which allows you to discover the name, address and gives a link to the establishment's website. 

## UX
This website will be used by people looking to travel to desired destinations who want to research places they may be travelling to or even for people who want to find an establishment close to them. 

  * As a user, I want to be able to search anywhere in the world on a map generated by this website.     
  * As a user, once I have entered my desired destination, I want to be able to search for tourist attractions/places of interest, places to eat or hotels near my searched location.
  * As a user, I want to be able to research establishments I have found by clicking on the markers and finding out their name, address and I would like the ability to be go to their website.   
  * As a user, I want the ability to search recommended destinations put forward by a website in order to narrow down my search options.

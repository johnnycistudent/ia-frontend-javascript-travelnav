# Interactive Front End Milestone Project

Welcome to my Interactive Front End Milestone Project. This website, which I have named Travel-Nav, allows users to search any destination in the world and find tourist attractions, places to eat and places to stay.
Once a user has entered a destination into the search bar above the map, the map will pan and zoom to their desired destination and will populate with markers from whichever button is currently active from the button group above the map.
Once the  markers have populated, you can click on them and explore the infoWindow that pops up, which allows you to discover the place's name, address, phone number and gives a link to the establishment's website. 
This website also features a "City Break" section, which recommends destinations to the user. Once the images of Paris, Rome or New York are hovered over, the ability to explore the respective city is available via an "Explore" button that appears and links directly to those places in the map.

## UX
This website will be used by people looking to travel to desired destinations who want to research places they may be travelling to or even for people who want to find an establishment close to them. 

  * As a user, I want to be able to search anywhere in the world on a map generated by this website.     
  * As a user, once I have entered my desired destination, I want to be able to search for tourist attractions/places of interest, places to eat or hotels near my searched location.
  * As a user, I want to be able to research establishments I have found by clicking on the markers and finding out their name, address, phone number and I would like the ability to be go to their website.   
  * As a user, I want the ability to search recommended destinations put forward by a website in order to narrow down my search options.

## Features

### Existing Features

  *   **Navbar** - The Navbar is edited from Bootstrap/Bootswatch and is responsive when the screen goes to mobile devices, with the links on the right collapsing to a Hamburger Menu. The website logo/name is featured in the top left corner at all times.
  *   **Hero Image** - The Hero Image is there to welcome the user to the website with a pleasant city coastal image view and features the call to action button with the website's tagline just above it.
  *   **Call-to-Action button** - This button features the phrase "Navigate your Travels" and when clicked, scrolls down the page to the map section. 
  *   **Map section** - The Map section is directly under the hero image, easily scrollable and linked to by the CTA button in the hero image and a menu link in the Navbar. It features the Map itself, the search bar and the buttons for controlling the markers of the map.
  *   **Search bar** - The Search bar is linked to the Map and suggests autocomplete queries when the user starts typing in to the search bar. Once the user chooses a location, the map pans to that location and generates markers based on which of the map buttons is active.
  *   **Map Buttons** - As mentioned above, the Map buttons will generate the markers of either "Attractions", "Food" and "Hotels" depending on which is active when the user chooses a location. When the page is loaded, the map button that is active by default is the "Attractions" button. 
  *   **Map** - The Map itself renders on a view of Dublin and is controlled by the search bar and the buttons above it. 
  *   **Marker Info Window** - Once the markers are generated by the users query and the map button that is active, the markers generated are clickable. Once one is clicked, an Info Window appears with the name, address, phone number and website of the establishment. 
  *   **City Break section** - The City Break section is designed to direct the user to three suggested destinations; Paris, Rome and New York. When the user hovers over the image of these cities, a button inviting them to explore the destinations appears and when clicked, the page scrolls to the map section and the map pans to the destination that is clicked on. 
  *   **Footer** - The Footer features my initials, a copyright icon and a link to my GitHub page represented by the GitHub symbol.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

  * As a user, I want to be able to search anywhere in the world on a map generated by this website.  
    **i.** Go to the map section,  by either scrolling down or clicking on the CTA button.  
    **ii.** Start typing into the search bar and verify the desired location appears in the suggestions below.  
    **iii.** Select the location from the suggested queries and verify the map pans to the correct location.  

  * As a user, once I have entered my desired destination, I want to be able to search for tourist attractions/places of interest, places to eat or hotels near my searched location.  
    **i.** Once the map has panned to the desired destination, markers will be generated by the the button above the map with the active class which by default is the "Attractions" button.   
    **ii.** Verify that the markers of establishments that are generated are for points of interests in that area of the map.  
    **iii.** Click on the "Food" button to generate markers for places to eat and click on the "Hotels" button to generate markers for types of lodging establishments.   
    **iv.** Drag the map with the cursor and verify the markers re-generate when the window view changes.   

  * As a user, I want to be able to research establishments I have found by clicking on the markers and finding out their name, address, phone number and I would like the ability to be go to their website.  
    **i.** Once the "Hotel" button is active and the map has panned to the location chosen in the search bar, click on one of the markers and verify an information window appears above the marker.  
    **ii.** Verify the following information is present; Name, Address, Phone number and website (if available).   
    **iii.** Click on the "Go to Website" link and verify the establishment's website opens in a new tab.   

  * As a user, I want the ability to search recommended destinations put forward by a website in order to narrow down my search options.  
    **i.** Go to the City Break section,  by either scrolling down or clicking on the City Break link in the Navbar menu.   
    **ii.** Hover over the image of Paris and a button entitled "Explore Paris" will appear.   
    **iii.** Click on the "Explore Paris" button and verify that the page scrolls up to the Map section and the map view pans to Paris, with the markers for whichever button is active generated. 

### Responsiveness
  * I have tested out the responsivesness of the website on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox using Dev tools. I have also tested the website on the devices below, both in horizontal and vertical view ports and they have all worked nicely.
   
    * Small devices - iPhone 6s, Samsung J5, Samsung S9. 
    * Medium devices - iPad. 
    * Large/Extra Large devices - Lenovo ideapad 520, Asus Vivobook.  

### Bugs
  * On iOS touchscreen devices, the overlays on the City Break images were not triggered by being touched. I found out a fix for that at [https://codepen.io/Wodger/pen/jbVJVv](https://codepen.io/Wodger/pen/jbVJVv), where adding "onClick="return true"" to the "hovereffect" div allowed the element containing the button link to the map to behave as they would with non-Apple touchscreens. 
  * When using the search bar above the map, if the user pressed enter instead of clicking one of the autosuggested results, the page would refresh as though a form was submitted due to the bootstrap form action. I fixed this with a jquery solution on line 266 of the maps.js in the JS folder. 

### Validation

  * I have validated my html code through [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/) and my css code through [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and no errors have occurred.
